**For detailed technical information**: See [Performance Optimizations](docs/commits/02-performance-optimizations.md)

## 🔍 Common Challenges You'll Encounter

As you work through this codebase, you may encounter several types of issues:

- Build System Configuration
- OpenGL Context Setup
- Mathematical Precision
- Memory Management
- Performance Bottlenecks

Remember: The core algorithms are mathematically sound - focus on implementation and optimization!

## 🚀 BUILD AND RUN

### Install Dependencies:
```bash
brew install glfw glew cglm pkg-config openssl
```

### Build (Optimized):
```bash
make clean && make
```

The build system includes comprehensive optimizations for maximum performance.

### Usage:
```bash
# Use default parameters
./morphosis -d

# Custom Julia set parameters
./morphosis <step_size> <q.x> <q.y> <q.z> <q.w>
# Example: ./morphosis 0.1 -0.7 0.27015 0 0

# Read from matrix file
./morphosis -m <matrix_file.mat>

# Read from poem file
./morphosis -p <poem_file>
```

### Controls:
- **ESC**: Exit the application
- **S**: Save and export the fractal as an OBJ file

### Example Commands:
```bash
# Classic Julia set
echo "100" | ./morphosis 0.05 -0.8 0.156 0 0

# Spiral patterns
echo "150" | ./morphosis 0.08 -0.7 0.27015 0 0

# Default parameters
./morphosis -d
```
